FEREYDOUN'S OLD PERSIAN CUNEIFORM FONTS


D e s c r i p t i o n

Developed with the help of Mr. Keyvan Mahmmoudi, from the University of Teheran, the glyphs are allocated over very convenient keys, but also works for Unicode. This font includes every known glyph for this ancient inscript. This is a free non-commercial font and should not be selled by any means.
