This font is part of Kingdom Hearts Re:Collection; a free archive of art assets and custom fonts created by Televo: https://github.com/Televo/kingdom-hearts-recollection

In comparison to similar fonts (DFPW5_EUR.ttf, KH_ALL_MENU_I.ttf and Kingdom_Hearts_Font.ttf) the font characters in Re:Collection have all been accurately recreated directly from the games where possible (notably KHTitle and KHScala) and they have vastly improved spacing/kerning (when using metric spacing).

If you decide to use these fonts publicly, giving credit is much appreciated though not necessary. Please feel free to message me anytime on Discord at Televo#9400 as I love to see how my efforts here have helped you create something awesome.

If you appreciate what I do with all your heart, consider supporting me on KoFi: https://ko-fi.com/televo
